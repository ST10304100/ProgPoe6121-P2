# Claims System: Contract Monthly Claim System (CMCS) Prototype

## Overview
Claims System is a prototype application designed for managing claims within an academic institution. This application includes a graphical user interface (GUI) created using .NET Core and provides a foundational structure for the upcoming functionalities of the Contract Monthly Claim System (CMCS). The current prototype focuses on the layout and design while planning for future features to automate claim processing and management.

## Sprints

### Part 1
In Part 1, the following tasks were completed:
- **Documentation**: Created comprehensive project documentation.
- **UML Class Diagram**: Designed a UML class diagram to illustrate the relationships between classes in the database.
- **Project Plan**: Developed a project plan outlining the development stages and timelines.
- **GUI Design**: Created a front-end design prototype focusing on user experience.

### Part 2
Building on the prototype from Part 1, the following functionalities were implemented:
- **Claim Submission**: Lecturers can submit claims through an intuitive form, capturing hours worked, hourly rate, and additional notes.
- **Claims Verification**: Separate views for Programme Coordinators and Academic Managers to verify, approve, or reject claims with a clear display of necessary details.
- **Document Upload**: Allowing lecturers to upload supporting documents securely linked to their claims.
- **Claim Status Tracking**: Implemented a real-time status update system for claims, showing their progress through approval.
- **Unit Testing**: Developed unit tests for key functionalities, ensuring the application handles errors gracefully.

### Part 3 (Future Scope)
In the next phase, the following functionalities are planned for automation:
- **Automated Payment Processing**: Automate the final payment for lecturers based on their submitted claims.
- **Validation System**: Implement a system to check submitted claims against predefined criteria (hours worked and hourly rate).
- **User Management**: Allow HR Managers to manage users (Lecturers, Programme Coordinators, Academic Managers) and generate invoices and reports summarizing approved claims for payment processing.
